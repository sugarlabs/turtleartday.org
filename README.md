# Turtle Art Day

## What is Turtle Art?

Every child can place puzzle blocks together. 
In a Turtle Art program the blocks tell a turtle to move about on screen, and to draw lines and arcs in different colors.
A sequence of blocks is code that describes a piece of art. 

Some blocks can create patterns by repeating sequences of other blocks, or can make logical decisions.
This kind of programming is inspired by the programming language LOGO. 
It was designed in the 1970s to be easy enough for kids and powerful enough for all ages to have fun. 
We can learn about geometry and programming while creating art.

Today Turtle Art is used by thousands of people around the world, especially in countries where schools use the [Sugar](http://www.sugarlabs.org) learning platform.

## What is Turtle Art Day?

Turtle Art Day is an international celebration of Turtle Art. 
Events are held around the world where people share their projects and experiences.

Each Turtle Art Day event is different. 
In different parts of the world, organizers plan different events for different audiences.

No matter whether you are an experienced or new to the community, Turtle Art Day is a great way to have fun making art with computers!
